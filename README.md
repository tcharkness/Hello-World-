# Hello-World-
Trying to learn this for a future resume.
'cause pimpin aint easy an im feeling way sleezy 
been tatting for going on 17 years an i'm ready
fo a new career. I got a useless BFA in 2001 but 
I can make a PC twerk that thang, so i'm gonna
roll wit dat.

Seriously though my body's wrecked and I need
to figure a way of making my way in the world
that doesn't involve rubber gloves and pain.
I've got some funny campfire stories about being
a tattooer, but methinks I could leverage that
stress-capability towards web design, hopefully
full-stack once i've got my feet wet. If I can
tattoo A-OK with a loaded .45 pointed at me and
four jacked up hells angels looking shady my way,
I can probably deal with some 25 yr old handing
out shit sandwiches and unwanted advice.
